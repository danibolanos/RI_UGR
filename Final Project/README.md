# Seam-Carving Algorithm

Implementation of the Seam-Carving algorithm to resize images while preserving the most relevant content. The algorithm is based on eliminating the seams with the smallest colour difference between neighbouring pixels. Implementation in Python using the OpenCV library and testing on a set of images contained in the project.
